Easily search for the selected text in other search engines (Bing, Google, Ask, Yahoo) by right-clicking.

This extenion provides an option when you right click on anything (text, links, etc.) to search for the selected text on different search engines. These search engines are Google, Bing, Ask, and Yahoo! 

There is a handy History featyre to show you your past searches, and a soon-to-come settings page to set how many history items you want.
